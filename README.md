"Sell Me" is a prototype that uses the latest advancements in LLMs and image recognition in order to identify random items of a house-hold that someone may want to sell. The interface guides the user to upload an image of an item. Once uploaded, the application returns a prediction of what it thinks the item is and the approximate cost. This metadata is stored in the user's dashboard, which allows them to begin organizing items they want to sell and to get an estimate on how much value the total number of uploaded items are worth. Future functionality will allow a user to verify uploads and initiate a post on a third-party platform (i.e. eBay) in order to sell their items to someone else.
